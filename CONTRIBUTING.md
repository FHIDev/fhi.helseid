# Contributing

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in contributing to the project.  We really appreciate all kinds of contributions!

There are several ways of contributing:

* Issues
    * Raise issues, elaborate or confirm issues, or help answer issues
    * Bugs, New Features, Questions
* Pull Requests
    * Create a fix for an issue, and raise a Pull Request
    * Review a pull request
* Documentation
    * Help improving the documentation

## Creating issues

* Use descriptive titles
* Provide a detailed description
* Describe how to reproduce the issue, 
* Add preferably a small repro project (which can be included as a zip, or point to a gist or other repo).  The repro should compile "as is".


## Contributing code - and raise a Pull Request (PR)

When you want to contribute code, we ask you to follow a few guidelines:

* Work on **one** issue at a time
    * Ensure you concentrate on a single issue in a single PR.  Avoid "refactoring" existing code which is not related to your fix.  (Refactoring something can be a separate issue in itself.)
* Follow the same code standard you see is already used.  
* Try to add unit tests for your code.

## Releasing new versions of the software

The Fhi.HelseId library is packaged and released automatically from the 'master' branch to.
A nuget package is built and pushed to Nuget.org if the version number of the Fhi.HelseId project changes.
